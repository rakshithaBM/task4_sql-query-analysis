## 📂 Project Overview
In this task, I worked with a dataset containing sales call records handled by different agents.  
The goal was to:
- Create and manage SQL tables.
- Insert and query data.
- Perform filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, and create views.
- Generate insights about call performance, sales conversion, and agent efficiency.

The dataset included the following key columns:
- **AgentID** – ID of the sales agent
- **CallID** – Unique call identifier
- **CustomerID** – ID of the customer
- **PickedUp** – Whether the call was answered (1) or missed (0)
- **Duration** – Call length in seconds
- **ProductSold** – Whether a sale occurred (1) or not (0)
- **Agent_Name** – Name of the sales agent

## 📊 Key Insights
- Identified top-performing agents based on sales conversion rates.
- Calculated average call durations and total calls per agent.
- Analyzed picked vs. missed calls for performance evaluation.
- Created a database view for high-performance agents.
